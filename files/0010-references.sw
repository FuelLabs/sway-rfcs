/// This file contains detailed examples of the syntax and semantics of references.

/// # Major design decisions
/// 1. References have their own mutability and can point to mutable or immutable values.
///    Thus, we support mutable references to mutable values and any combination of the two.
///    Target mutability is not automatically taken over from the referenced value, and
///    must be specified explicitely. E.g.:
///
///    let mut m_i = 0u64;
///    let r_m_i = &mut m_i; // Immutable reference to a mutable `m_i`.
///    let mut m_r_m_i = &mut m_i; // Mutable reference to a mutable `m_i`.
///    let r_m_i = &m_i; // Immutable reference to an immutable (via reference) `m_i`.
///    let mut r_m_i = &m_i; // Mutable reference to an immutable (via reference) `m_i`.
///
///    The need to specify `mut` in the second case is likely cumbersome because it will be
///    the default wanted behavior, but it gives us clear syntax later on when having references
///    in aggreagates and when sending and returning them from functions.
///
///    let i = 0u64;
///    let r_m_i = &mut i; // ERROR: `i` is not mutable.
///
/// 2. & operator defines the reference. * operator is dereferencing.
///
/// 3. . and [] operators also dereference if the reference is a reference to a struct/tuple or array, respectively.
